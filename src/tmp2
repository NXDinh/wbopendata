5.51.01.02.malnut#Child malnutrition#3#Economy and Growth#########36 Statistical Capacity Indicators#Prevalence of underweight children under-five years of age, also known as prevalence of child malnutrition (weight for age), is the percentage of children under-five whose weight for age is less than minus two standard deviations from the median for the international reference population ages 0 to 59 months. The data are based on the World Health Organization’s new child growth standards released in 2006. Child malnutrition is linked to poverty, low levels of education, and poor access to health services. Sufficient and good-quality nutrition is therefore critical for development, health, and survival of current and succeeding generations.

Women have an enormous impact on the well-being of their families and societies, but their potential is sometimes not realized because of discriminatory social norms, incentives, and legal institutions. Although their status has improved in recent decades, gender inequalities persist. Education is one of the most important aspects of human development, and eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education would help to increase the status and capabilities of women. This indicator provides a measure of equality of educational opportunity and relates to the third MDG that seeks to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women.#World Development Indicator (WDI) databank.

9.1_AID.ALIGNMENT#Alignment of aid to education (% of total international aid to education)#10#Social Protection and Labor#########34 Global Partnership for Education#Estimated international education aid reported on the government’s budget and expressed as a percentage of the disbursed education aid for the government sector. Government sector aid includes aid disbursed in the context of an agreement with administrations (ministries, departments, agencies or municipalities) authorized to receive revenue or undertake expenditures on behalf of central government. This is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector, an unprecedented picture of aid effectiveness in the education sector that can be used as the basis for in-country dialogue and debate going forward. This information looks at how education aid is delivered and managed by development partners and governments.#This indicator is part of the 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Development Effectiveness in the Education Sector. Data was collected in 2011 by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) from Ministries of Education and development partners on selected Paris Declaration indicators, which were adapted for the education sector, and on other additional information. Three tools were used to collect this data: the Ministry of Education Questionnaire and the Donor questionnaire for quantitative data, and an Explanatory Note for qualitative data. The GPE Secretariat worked closely with Local Education Groups (LEGs ) to collect, process, produce, review and validate this information; and the Coordinating Agency or lead donor was tasked to coordinate the exercise with the LEG and to work with the Ministry of Education. Information refers to data from 2010.

PFM systems include budge execution procedures, financial reporting procedures and auditing procedures. Donors use national budget execution procedures when the funds they provide are managed according to the national budgeting procedures established in the general legislation and implemented by government. The use of national financial reporting means that donors do not impose additional requirements on governments for financial reporting. The use of national auditing procedures means that donors rely on the audit opinions issued by the country's supreme audit institution and on the government's normal financial reports statements. Government sector aid includes aid disbursed in the context of an agreement with administrations (ministries, departments, agencies or municipalities) authorized to receive revenue or undertake expenditures on behalf of central government.

9.6_PBA#Aid provided through program based approaches (% of international aid to education)#10#Social Protection and Labor#########34 Global Partnership for Education#International education aid provided in the context of programme-based approaches (PBAs) and expressed as a percentage of the total disbursed education aid. This indicator is measured by the donors’ use of (general or sector) budget support and or joint financing mechanisms such as pool funding mechanisms. PBA is a way of engaging in development co-operation based on the principles of coordinated support for a locally owned programme of development, such as a national education plan. Programme-based approaches share the following features: Leadership by the host country; a single comprehensive programme and budget framework; a formalized process for donor coordination and harmonization of donor procedures; efforts to increase the use of country systems.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.< wb:sourceNote#Food and Agriculture Organization, electronic files and web site.#1058#0# _api_read ,   page(1058)    per_page(1)     list parameter( indicator?id name topic?id )

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.

BX.TRF.PWKR.GD.ZS#Workers' remittances, receipts (% of GDP)#3#Economy and Growth#7#Financial Sector#20#External Debt#####11 Africa Development Indicators#Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices. This item shows receipts by the reporting country.
