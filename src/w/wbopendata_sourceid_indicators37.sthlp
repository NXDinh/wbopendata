{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The Gini coefficient is most common measure of inequality. It is based on the Lorenz curve, a cumulative frequency curve that compares the distribution of a specific variable (in this case, income) with the uniform distribution that represents equality. The Gini coefficient is bounded by 0 (indicating perfect equality of income) and 1, which means complete inequality. This calculation includes observations of 0 income..{p_end}

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The parameter Î± in the GE class represents the weight given to distances between incomes at different parts of the income distribution, and can take any real value. For lower values of Î±, GE is more sensitive to changes in the lower tail of the distribution, and for higher values GE is more sensitive to changes that affect the upper tail.
