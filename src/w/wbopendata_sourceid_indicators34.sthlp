{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Coordinating Agency (CA) or lead donor in the Local Education Group (LEG) coordinates and facilitates partners’ engagement with the Global Partnership for Education, thus serving as the communication link between the LEG and the Secretariat. The CA has a central role in facilitating the work of the LEG and is selected by this group. The LEG is the local structure of the Global Partnership for Education that bring together partners to develop high quality education strategies and programs. They are typically led by the Ministry of Education and include development partners and other education stakeholders such as national government and public entities, local and international civil society organizations (CSOs), CSO coalitions, teachers' and parents' organizations and private sector providers. The specific composition, title, and working arrangements of the LEG will vary from country to country. The LEG should be a collaborative forum for policy dialogue and for alignment and harmonization of technical and financial support to the education sector plan. It seeks to ensure that all parties are kept fully apprised of the progress and challenges in the sector, and it collates and disseminates information on domestic and external funding for the education sector.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt Source Organization}}The 2011 Monitoring Exercise on Aid Effectiveness in the Education Sector was produced by the Global Partnership for Education in parallel to the OECD’s 2011 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration. Through this exercise participating donors reported on the international aid allocated and projected to specific developing countries. Data were later validated and/or updated when preparing the GPE Results Report in 2012. Most of the figures were reported in 2011 and in USD. When it was not the case, currencies were converted to USD. Data are relative to a calendar year, unless it is specified otherwise in the country notes. For further details in this 2012 Monitoring Exercise, please refer to the following web site: {browse "http://www.globalpartnership.org/our-work/areas-of-focus/aid-effectiveness/2011-monitoring-exercise-on-aid-effectiveness-2/"}{p_end}
