{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The Logistics Performance Index overall rank reflects perceptions of a countrys logistics performance based on the efficiency of the customs clearance process, quality of trade- and transport-related infrastructure, ease of arranging competitively priced international shipments, quality of logistics services, ability to track and trace consignments, and frequency with which shipments reach the consignee within the scheduled time. The ranks range from 1 to 160 (in the 2018, 2016, and 2014 edition; 155 in 2012 and 2010, and 150 in 2007), with a lower rank representing better performance. Data are from the Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. The 2018 round of surveys covered close to 6,000 country assessments by around 1,000 international freight forwarders. Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology are available in Arvis, Ojala, Wiederer, Shepherd, Raj, Dairabayeva, Kiiski: Connecting to Compete 2018: The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators, see Appendix 5 for methodology.{p_end}

Data are from the Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. The 2018 round of surveys covered close to 6,000 country assessments by around 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight economies on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The economies are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondents country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

To account for the sampling error created by the LPIâ€™s survey-based dataset, LPI ranks are presented with approximate 80 percent confidence intervals (see appendix 5 of the LPI report available at lpi.worldbank.org). These intervals yield upper and lower bounds for a countryâ€™s LPI rank.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The Logistics Performance Index reflects perceptions of a countrys logistics performance based on six components. The component Frequency with which shipments reach consignee within scheduled or expected time includes results from the survey question When arranging shipments to the countries listed below, how often do they reach the consignee within the scheduled or expected delivery time? Data are from the Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. The 2018 round of surveys covered close to 6,000 country assessments by around 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight economies on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The economies are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondents country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis. Details of the survey methodology and index construction methodology are available in Arvis, Ojala, Wiederer, Shepherd, Raj, Dairabayeva, Kiiski: Connecting to Compete 2018: The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators, see Appendix 5 for methodology.{p_end}
