{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The Human Opportunities Index (HOI) is an economic indicator that captures the degree of inequality of access to an essential service by different circumstance groups. This index takes into account the average access rate (the coverage) of a given opportunity (service) and the inequality of its distribution. The circumstances included in the HOI are the gender of the child, parents' education, household per capita income, number of siblings, presence of both parents in the household, gender of the household head, and urban or rural residence.An increase in the index can be related either to an increase in the coverage or to a more equal distribution of that service..{p_end}

When reading Literary Texts, students at the advanced international benchmarking level can: A) Integrate ideas and evidence across a text to appreciate overall themes, and B) Interpret story events and character actions to provide reasons, motivations, feelings, and character traits with full text-based support. When reading Informational Texts, students at the advanced international benchmark can A) Distinguish and interpret complex information from different parts of text, and provide full text-based support, B) Integrate information across a text to provide explanations, interpret significance, and sequence activities, and C) Evaluate visual and textual features to explain their function. The procedure for identifying International Benchmarks changed from the PIRLS 2001 method of using percentiles to a method based on scores that do not change from PIRLS cycle to cycle. In PIRLS 2001, the Advanced benchmark was called the Top 10% Benchmark (90th percentile score), which corresponded to a scale score of 615. The 2001 data in this database were recalculated based on a 625 Advanced Benchmark score and are different than the data found in the 2001 PIRLS report.

When reading Informational Texts, students at this benchmarking level can: A) Locate and distinguish relevant information within a dense text or a complex table, B) Make inferences about logical connections to provide explanations and reasons, C) Integrate textual and visual information to interpret the relationship between ideas, and D) Evaluate content and textual elements to make a generalization. The procedure for identifying International Benchmarks changed from the PIRLS 2001 method of using percentiles to a method based on scores that do not change from PIRLS cycle to cycle. In PIRLS 2001, the High Benchmark was called the Upper Quarter Benchmark or 75th percentile score, which corresponded to a scale score of 570. The 2001 data in this database were recalculated based on a 550 High Benchmark score and are different than the data found in the 2001 PIRLS report.

The indicator reflects the overall level of development of an education system in terms of the average number of years of schooling without repetition that can be offered to the school-age population, including those who never enter school. It is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the given level of education, plus the number of pupils of unknown age in the given level of education divided by the school-age population for that level of education, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education, minus the number of repeaters in a given level of education divided by the school-age population for that level, multiplied by the duration of that level of education..{p_end}
