The indicator measures students' ability to fluently decipher/decode randomly-presented “words” that follow linguistic rules but do not actually exist in the stated language. Skill in reading nonwords can be a purer measure of decoding than using real words because children cannot recognize the words by sight. Decoding is considered a self-teaching skill that enables children to read new and unfamiliar words independently.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Percentage of young (age 16-24) adults scoring 326 to less than 376 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. Tasks at this level often require respondents to perform multiple-step operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesize information from complex or lengthy continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple type texts. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge may be needed to perform the task successfully. Many tasks require identifying and understanding one or more specific, non-central idea(s) in the text in order to interpret or evaluate subtle evidence-claim or persuasive discourse relationships. Conditional information is frequently present in tasks at this level and must be taken into consideration by the respondent. Competing information is present and sometimes seemingly as prominent as correct information. The target population was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-24 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. The percentage of adults scoring at different levels of proficiency adds up to 100% when the percentage of literacy-related non-respondents are taken into account. Adults in this category were not able to complete the background questionnaire due to language difficulties or learning and mental disabilities (literacy-related non-response).

When reading Informational Texts, students at the advanced international benchmark can A) Distinguish and interpret complex information from different parts of text, and provide full text-based support, B) Integrate information across a text to provide explanations, interpret significance, and sequence activities, and C) Evaluate visual and textual features to explain their function. The procedure for identifying International Benchmarks changed from the PIRLS 2001 method of using percentiles to a method based on scores that do not change from PIRLS cycle to cycle. In PIRLS 2001, the Advanced benchmark was called the Top 10% Benchmark (90th percentile score), which corresponded to a scale score of 615. The 2001 data in this database were recalculated based on a 625 Advanced Benchmark score and are different than the data found in the 2001 PIRLS report.

This does not necessarily mean that they are illiterate, but that there is insufficient information on which to base a description of their reading proficiency. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Below Level 1 to Level 5) than later assessments, which use a reading scale from Below Level 1B to Level 6. Because an equivalent proficiency level to Below Level 1B and Level 1B were not calculated for the 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA Reports, the data are not currently available for those years.

Most of the tasks at this level require the respondent to read relatively short digital or print continuous, non-continuous, or mixed texts to locate a single piece of information that is identical to or synonymous with the information given in the question or directive. Some tasks, such as those involving non-continuous texts, may require the respondent to enter personal information onto a document. Little, if any, competing information is present. Some tasks may require simple cycling through more than one piece of information. Knowledge and skill in recognizing basic vocabulary determining the meaning of sentences, and reading paragraphs of text is expected.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential. Literacy encompasses a range of skills from the decoding of written words and sentences to the comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation of complex texts. It does not, however, involve the production of text (writing). Information on the skills of adults with low levels of proficiency is provided by an assessment of reading components that covers text vocabulary, sentence comprehension and passage fluency. The target population for the survey was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential. Literacy encompasses a range of skills from the decoding of written words and sentences to the comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation of complex texts. It does not, however, involve the production of text (writing). Information on the skills of adults with low levels of proficiency is provided by an assessment of reading components that covers text vocabulary, sentence comprehension and passage fluency. The target population was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-24 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. Literacy-related non-respondents are not included in the calculation of the mean scores which, thus, present an upper bound of the estimated literacy proficiency of the population.

When reading Informational Texts, students at the advanced international benchmark can A) Distinguish and interpret complex information from different parts of text, and provide full text-based support, B) Integrate information across a text to provide explanations, interpret significance, and sequence activities, and C) Evaluate visual and textual features to explain their function. The procedure for identifying International Benchmarks changed from the PIRLS 2001 method of using percentiles to a method based on scores that do not change from PIRLS cycle to cycle. In PIRLS 2001, the Advanced benchmark was called the Top 10% Benchmark (90th percentile score), which corresponded to a scale score of 615. The 2001 data in this database were recalculated based on a 625 Advanced Benchmark score and are different than the data found in the 2001 PIRLS report.

Students with scores below Level 1b (less or equal to 262 points) usually do not succeed at the most basic reading tasks that PISA measures. This does not necessarily mean that they are illiterate, but that there is insufficient information on which to base a description of their reading proficiency.  2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Below Level 1 to Level 5) than later assessments, which use a reading scale from Below Level 1B to Level 6. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Below Level 1 to Level 5) than later assessments, which use a reading scale from Below Level 1B to Level 6. Because an equivalent proficiency level to Below Level 1B and Level 1B were not calculated for the 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA Reports, the data are not currently available for those years.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Starting salaries refer to the average scheduled gross salary per year for a full-time teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of the teaching career. Salaries are in equivalent USD converted using PPPs for private consumption. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, while actual salaries refer to the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher. The salaries reported are gross (total sum paid by the employer) less the employer’s contribution to social security and pension, according to existing salary scales. Salaries are “before tax”, i.e. before deductions for income tax. Teachers’ salaries are one component of teachers’ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers’ total remuneration. There are also large differences in taxation and social-benefits systems in OECD countries. All this should be borne in mind when comparing statutory salaries across countries.

{synopt:{opt Source}}12 Education Statistics{p_end}


{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the specified level of education. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education than the average.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The percentage of female population (age 25 and over) with incomplete primary as the highest level of educational attainment. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of females aged 25 years and above with incomplete primary education by the total female population of the same age group and multiplying the result by 100. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) educational attainment dataset shows the educational composition of the population aged 25 years and above and hence the stock and quality of human capital within a country. The dataset also reflects the structure and performance of the education system and its accumulated impact on human capital formation.

The data reported excludes books in school libraries as well as novels and books for use by teachers (such as curriculum guides, syllabi and teacher guides). Data Limitations: While national-level data may suggest all pupils have access to books in these countries, this may hide sub-national disparities. For example, pupils in some schools may have more than one textbook, while shortages may persist in others.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Total number of students in the theoretical age group for lower secondary education attending that level, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) calculates household survey-based education indicators using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer to attendance, e.g. “net attendance rate” or “adjusted net attendance rate”. The comparable indicator for administrative data is Net Enrolment Rate because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year.

Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer to attendance, e.g. “net attendance rate” or “adjusted net attendance rate”. The comparable indicator for administrative data is Net Enrolment Rate because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the specified levels of education. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education than the average.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the specified level of education. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Percentage of female adults scoring 276 to less than 326 points on the 0 to 500 point scale. Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, and include continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages of text. Understanding text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multi-step operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or inappropriate content to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information. The target population for the survey was the non-institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. The percentage of adults scoring at different levels of proficiency adds up to 100% when the percentage of literacy-related non-respondents are taken into account. Adults in this category were not able to complete the background questionnaire due to language difficulties or learning and mental disabilities (literacy-related non-response).

This indicator should not be considered a unit cost, since it only includes what the government spends, and not total spending per student (including household contributions). Since it is a simple division of total government expenditure by the number of students at a given level, whether they attend public or private institutions, in countries where private provision and/or funding of education is higher the average amount per student will appear lower.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Share of the population of the stated age group that has completed lower secondary or incomplete upper secondary education as the highest level of educational attainment. Projections are based on collected census and survey data for the base year (around 2010) and the Medium Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2) projection model. The SSP2 is a middle-of-the-road scenario that combines medium fertility with medium mortality, medium migration, and the Global Education Trend (GET) education scenario.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}Average total (current, capital and transfers) general government expenditure per student in the given level of education, expressed in US$ at market exchange rates, in constant prices. The constant prices base year is normally three years before the year of the data release. Divide total government expenditure (in constant US$) for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary) by total enrolment in that same level. This indicator is useful to compare average spending on one student between levels of education, over time, or between countries.

{synopt:{opt Source Notes}}The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of human development. It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices measuring achievements in each dimension. The HDI is the geometric mean of the three dimension indices and embodies imperfect substitutability across all HDI dimensions. It thus addresses one of the most serious criticisms of the linear aggregation formula, which allowed for perfect substitution across dimensions. Some substitutability is inherent in the definition of any index that increases with the values of its components.
